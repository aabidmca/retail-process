# hot to start retail-process service
1. Check out and build this project and go to package com.retailprocess
2. Run main class named with ApplicationInitializer as a java program
3. I have created one dummy user as Affiliate user and it would be tested 
   by Affiliate user by default, you can change this user as an employee
   or customer by changing Affiliate e.g. User user = Employee.builder()
   and set user type like UserType.Employee.name().
4. I have created some test cases for this.
